Guidelines
To make it easier for people to understand and navigate your work, we recommend that you create a README file for every repository. You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions. For more information, see 1.

We also recommend that you use branching over forking to streamline collaboration. Regular collaborators should work from a single repository, creating pull requests between branches instead of between repositories. Forking is best suited for accepting contributions from people that are unaffiliated with a project, such as open-source contributors. For more information, see 1.

Conclusion
We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about health care. Thank you for your interest in our repository! 🙏
